# Initialise a docker swarm, (--advertise-addr) advertise its address as a string and bind it
# to the docker-machine port 2377. The <> should be replaced with the Char docker-machine IP

docker swarm init --advertise-addr <Char docker-machine IP>:2377

# Only use port 2377 or leave it blank to use default(2377).

# To test:

docker node ls
